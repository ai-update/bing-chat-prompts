# bing-chat-prompts

A collection of prompts for Bing Chat.

The primary purpose of this project is to offer a diverse range of prompt (templates) that can be used to interact with Bing Chat effectively.

These templates are designed to streamline the process of generating high-quality responses from ChatGPT; making it easier for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to harness the full potential of the A.I. model.
